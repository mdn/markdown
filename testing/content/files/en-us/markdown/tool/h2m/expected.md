`Markdown` is a nicer format than `HTML`.

# Heading 1

Nothing to say, really.

## Heading 2

Basic formatting such as **bold** and _emphasis_.

Here's a section that simply mentions links like <https://www.peterbe.com> for example.

### Heading 3

A bullet point list:

- One
- Two
- Three

This is a paragraph with a link to [this page](/en-US/docs/Markdown/Tool/H2M).

## Other stuff

This is a paragraph with a link to [another page](/en-US/docs/Web).

> **Warning:** the above implementation is partially buggy. It is recommended to use `helloWorld();` instead.

> **Callout:** remember to remove unneeded whitespace.
